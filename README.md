- Hi, I’m @cameronjames-bit, current M.S. student 
- I'm interested in cryptography and secure communication channels, de-obfuscation methods, PQC, zero knowledge proofs, malware analysis, decision trees
- I’m currently learning side channel attacks on specific implementations of ECC on DH schemes 
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything really
